# CIS210-Tree-Traversal
An implementation of the tree data structure and example of several tree traversal methods.

Pre-order, post-order, and in-order methods are each shown. Two sets of tree content are used to emphasize the differences. Perry_Lab3_Output.txt shows the results of the traversal methods.
